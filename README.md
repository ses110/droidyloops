DroidyLoops
===========

DroidyLoops isan app where the idea is to collaboratively compose music by recording your own sounds 
and layering them to create songs.

The user will be able to record audio from his/her voice, instrument or any sound desired and the app 
will save it as a track (like a photoshop layer). The user can add and layer tracks as desired (as memory permits). 
These track layers can be moved around or deleted. Then the user can allow the public or certain people 
to collaborate on the song. Future plans will include a portal of “top” samples that people can add on to it. 
The user will then be able to export the song and use it in any way they want.
